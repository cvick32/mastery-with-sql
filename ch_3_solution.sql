-- 3.1 Write a query to list all the film titles

select title from film;

-- 3.2 Write a query to return the actor's first names and 
-- last names only (with the column headings "First Name" and "Last Name")

select first_name as "First Name", last_name as "Last Name" from actor;

-- 3.3 How many rows are in the inventory table?

select * from inventory;

-- 4581

-- 3.4 Write a query that returns all the columns from the actor 
-- table without using the * wildcard in the SELECT clause

select actor_id, first_name, last_name last_update from actor;

-- 3.5 Write a query to obtain the length of each customer's 
-- first name (*remember to look for string functions in the 
-- documentation that can help*)

select first_name, length(first_name) as length from customer;

-- 3.6 Write a query to return the initials for each customer

select 
	first_name,
	last_name, 
	upper(substring(first_name from 1 for 1) || substring(last_name from 1 for 1)) as initials -- solution uses left function
from customer;


-- 3.7 Each film has a rental_rate, which is how much money it costs for a customer to rent 
-- out the film. Each film also has a replacement_cost, which is how much money the film 
-- costs to replace. Write a query to figure out how many times each film must be rented 
-- out to cover its replacement cost.

select title, rental_rate, replacement_cost, ceiling(replacement_cost / rental_rate) as "num rentals to break-even" from film;

-- 3.8 Write a query to list all the films with a 'G' rating

-- 3.10 Write a query to list all the rentals made before June, 2005

select rental_id, rental_date from rental
where rental_date < '2005-06-01';

-- 3.11 In Exercise 3.7, you wrote a query to figure out how many times each film
-- must be rented out to cover its replacement cost. Now write a query to return 
-- only those films that must be rented out more than 30 times to cover their replacement cost.

select title, 
	rental_rate, 
	replacement_cost,

-- 3.13 Weâ€™re trying to list all films with a length of an hour or less. Show two 
-- different ways to fix our query below that isn't working (one using the NOT keyword, and one without)

select title, rental_duration, length
from film
where not length > 60;

select title, rental_duration, length
from film
where length <= 60;

-- 3.14 Explain what each of the two queries below are doing and why
--  they generate different results. Which one is probably a mistake and why?

select title, rating
from film
where rating != 'G'
  and rating != 'PG';
-- filters all movies with G and PG ratings
 
select title, rating
from film
where rating != 'G'
  or rating != 'PG';
-- doesn't really filter anything, probably the mistake 
 

-- 3.15 Write a single query to show all rentals where the return date is greater than the 
-- rental date, or the return date is equal to the rental date, or the return date is less 
-- than the rental date. How many rows are returned? Why doesn't this match the number of 
-- rows in the table overall?

 
 select rental_id, rental_date, return_date from rental
where (return_date > rental_date) or
	  (return_date = rental_date) or
	  (return_date < rental_date);
 
 -- could be null values
 
-- 3.16 Write a query to list the rentals that haven't been returned


 select rental_id, return_date from rental 
 where return_date is null;
 
-- 3.17 Write a query to list the films that have a rating that is not 'G' or 'PG'

select title, rating from film 
where rating != 'G' and rating != 'PG' or rating is null;
 
 
-- 3.18 Write a query to return the films with a rating of 'PG', 'G', or 'PG-13'

select title, rating from film
where rating in ('PG', 'G', 'PG-13');
 

-- 3.19 Write a query equivalent to the one below using BETWEEN.

from film
where length >= 90
  and length <= 120;
 
select title, length
from film
where length between 90 and 120;

-- 3.20 Write a query to return all film titles that end with the word "GRAFFITI"

select title from film 
where title like '%GRAFFITI';

-- 3.21 In exercise 3.17 you wrote a query to list the films that have a rating that is not 'G' or 'PG'. 
-- Re-write this query using NOT IN. Do your results include films with a NULL rating?

select title, rating from film 
where rating not in ('PG', 'G');

select first_name, last_name 
from customer

from rental
where date_part('hour', rental_date) >= 22;

-- 3.27 Write a query to return the 3 most recent payments received

select payment_id, payment_date
from payment
order by payment_date desc
limit 3;

-- 3.28 Return the 4 films with the shortest length that are not R rated. For films with the same length, order them alphabetically

order by length, title
limit 4;

-- 3.29 Write a query to return the last 3 payments made in January, 2007

from payment
where payment_date < '2007-02-01'
  and payment_date >= '2007-01-01'
order by payment_date desc
limit 3;

-- 3.30 Can you think of a way you could, as in the previous exercise, 
-- return the last 3 payments made in January, 2007 but have those same 3 
-- output rows ordered by date ascending? (Don't spend too long on this...)

select payment_id, amount, payment_date

where rating is not null;


-- 3.32 Write a query to help us quickly see if there is any hour of the day that we have never rented a film out on (maybe the staff always head out for lunch?)

select distinct date_part('hour', rental_date) as hr
from rental
order by hr;


-- 3.33 Write a query to help quickly check whether the same rental 
-- rate is used for each rental duration (for example - is the rental rate always 4.99 when the rental duration is 3?)

select distinct rental_duration, rental_rate
from film
order by rental_duration, rental_rate desc;

-- 3.34 Can you explain why the first query below works, but the second one, which simply adds the DISTINCT keyword, doesn't? (this is quite challenging)

select first_name
from actor
order by last_name;

select distinct first_name
from actor
order by last_name;
-- order by expressions must appear in select list


-- 3.35 Write a query to return an ordered list of distinct ratings for films in 
-- our films table along with their descriptions (you will have to type in the descriptions yourself)

		when 'PG' then 'Parental Guidance Recommended'
		when 'PG-13' then 'Parents Strongly Cautioned'
		when 'R' then 'Restricted'
		when 'NC-17' then 'Adults Only'
	end as "rating_description"
from film
where rating is not null
order by rating;

-- 3.36 Write a query to output 'Returned' for returned rentals and 'Not Returned' for rentals that 
-- haven't been returned. Order the output to show those not returned first.

select rental_id, rental_date, return_date, 
	case

-- 3.37 Imagine you were asked to write a query to populate a 'country picker' for some internal company dashboard. 
-- Write a query to return the countries in alphabetical order, but also with the twist that the first 3 countries in the 
-- list must be 1) Australia 2) United Kingdom 3) United States and then normal alphabetical order after that (maybe you want 
-- them first because, for example, most of your customers come from these countries)

select country from country
order by 
	case country 
		when 'Australia' then 0
		when 'United Kingdom' then 1
		when 'United States' then 2
	end, country;


-- 3.38 We want to give a prize to 5 random customers each month. Write a query that will return 5 random customers each 
-- time it is run (you may find a particular math function helpful - make sure to search the documentation!)

select first_name, last_name, email from customer order by random() limit 5;
	
-- 3.39 Give 3 different solutions to list the rentals made in June, 2005. In one solution, use the 
-- date_part function. In another, use the BETWEEN keyword. In the third, don't use either date_part or BETWEEN.
	

select rental_id, rental_date
from rental
where date_part('month', rental_date) = 6 and date_part('year', rental_date) = 2005;

select rental_id, rental_date
from rental
where rental_date between '2005-06-01' and '2005-07-01';

select first_name from customer
where first_name like '%A%A%';


-- 3.42 PostgreSQL supports an interesting variation of DISTINCT called DISTINCT ON. Visit the official 
-- documentation page and read about DISTINCT ON. See if you can figure out how you would use it in a 
-- query to return the most recent rental for each customer

select distinct on (customer_id) customer_id, rental_date 
from rental
order by customer_id, rental_date desc;


-- 3.43 Write a query to list all the customers with an email address but not in the format [first_name].[last_name]@sakilacustomer.org
