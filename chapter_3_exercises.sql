-- 3.1 Write a query to list all the film titles

select title from film;

-- 3.2 Write a query to return the actor's first names and 
-- last names only (with the column headings "First Name" and "Last Name")

select first_name as "First Name", last_name as "Last Name" from actor;

-- 3.3 How many rows are in the inventory table?

select * from inventory;

-- 4581

-- 3.4 Write a query that returns all the columns from the actor 
-- table without using the * wildcard in the SELECT clause

select actor_id, first_name, last_name last_update from actor;

-- 3.5 Write a query to obtain the length of each customer's 
-- first name (*remember to look for string functions in the 
-- documentation that can help*)

select first_name, length(first_name) as length from customer;

-- 3.6 Write a query to return the initials for each customer

select 
	first_name,
	last_name, 
	upper(substring(first_name from 1 for 1) || substring(last_name from 1 for 1)) as initials -- solution uses left function
from customer;


-- 3.7 Each film has a rental_rate, which is how much money it costs for a customer to rent 
-- out the film. Each film also has a replacement_cost, which is how much money the film 
-- costs to replace. Write a query to figure out how many times each film must be rented 
-- out to cover its replacement cost.

select title, rental_rate, replacement_cost, ceiling(replacement_cost / rental_rate) as "num rentals to break-even" from film;

-- 3.8 Write a query to list all the films with a 'G' rating

select title, rating from film
where rating = 'G';

-- 3.9 List all the films longer than 2 hours (note each film 
-- has a length in minutes)

select title, length from film
where length > 120;

-- 3.10 Write a query to list all the rentals made before June, 2005

select rental_id, rental_date from rental
where rental_date < '2005-06-01';

-- 3.11 In Exercise 3.7, you wrote a query to figure out how many times each film
-- must be rented out to cover its replacement cost. Now write a query to return 
-- only those films that must be rented out more than 30 times to cover their replacement cost.

select title, 
	rental_rate, 
	replacement_cost, 
	ceiling(replacement_cost / rental_rate) as "num rentals to break-even" 
from film
where ceiling(replacement_cost / rental_rate) > 30;


-- 3.12 Write a query to show all rentals made by the customer with ID 388 in 2005

select rental_id, rental_date 
from rental
where customer_id = 388 and rental_date > '2005-01-01' and rental_date < '2006-01-01'; 

-- 3.13 Weâ€™re trying to list all films with a length of an hour or less. Show two 
-- different ways to fix our query below that isn't working (one using the NOT keyword, and one without)

select title, rental_duration, length
from film
where not length > 60;

select title, rental_duration, length
from film
where length <= 60;

-- 3.14 Explain what each of the two queries below are doing and why
--  they generate different results. Which one is probably a mistake and why?

select title, rating
from film
where rating != 'G'
  and rating != 'PG';
-- filters all movies with G and PG ratings
 
select title, rating
from film
where rating != 'G'
  or rating != 'PG';
-- doesn't really filter anything, probably the mistake 
 

-- 3.15 Write a single query to show all rentals where the return date is greater than the 
-- rental date, or the return date is equal to the rental date, or the return date is less 
-- than the rental date. How many rows are returned? Why doesn't this match the number of 
-- rows in the table overall?

 
 select rental_id, rental_date, return_date from rental
where (return_date > rental_date) or
	  (return_date = rental_date) or
	  (return_date < rental_date);
 
 -- could be null values
 
-- 3.16 Write a query to list the rentals that haven't been returned


 select rental_id, return_date from rental 
 where return_date is null;
 
-- 3.17 Write a query to list the films that have a rating that is not 'G' or 'PG'

select title, rating from film 
where rating != 'G' and rating != 'PG' or rating is null;
 
 
-- 3.18 Write a query to return the films with a rating of 'PG', 'G', or 'PG-13'

select title, rating from film
where rating in ('PG', 'G', 'PG-13');
 

-- 3.19 Write a query equivalent to the one below using BETWEEN.

select title, length
from film
where length >= 90
  and length <= 120;
 
select title, length
from film
where length between 90 and 120;

-- 3.20 Write a query to return all film titles that end with the word "GRAFFITI"

select title from film 
where title like '%GRAFFITI';

-- 3.21 In exercise 3.17 you wrote a query to list the films that have a rating that is not 'G' or 'PG'. 
-- Re-write this query using NOT IN. Do your results include films with a NULL rating?

select title, rating from film 
where rating not in ('PG', 'G');
